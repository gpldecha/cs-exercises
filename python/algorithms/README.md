# Python notes

### Lists

** insertion/removal**
- from the back: append(), pop()
- from the front: insert(), pop(0)

** other operations **
- reverse() : reverses the elements of a list in place.

Lits can be used efficiently as stacks both append() and pop()
are efficient. However insert(0, object) and pop(0) have to shift
the whole dataset by one.
