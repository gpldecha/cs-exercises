## Find the merge point of two joined linked lists

[hackerrank question](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-the-merge-point-of-two-joined-linked-lists/problem)

This is some sort of special algorithm.

A:  1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6
           /
B:       7

               A                |            B
A:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 :-> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

B:  7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6:-> 1  -> 2 -> 3

From the above it is clear that the intersection of both lists will be found

solutions which are less complicated but not as optimal.
