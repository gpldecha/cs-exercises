# Sorting
## simple sorts
* Selection sort

  time: O(N²)
  space: O(N)

* [Insertion sort](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/lecture/1hYlN/insertion-sort) 

 time: O(1/4 N²)
 space: O(1/4 N^2)

* Shell sort

 time: O(N^(3/2))
 
## advanced sorts
 * [Merge sort](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/lecture/ARWDq/mergesort)
 
  time  : O(N log N)
  
  space : O(N)
  
  stable : usually
  
  * [Quick sort](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/lecture/vjvnC/quicksort)

Invented by Tony Hoare, implementations (Lomuto partition scheme, Hoare scheme). The choice of the pivot's position is very important. 

"In the very early versions of quicksort, the leftmost element of the partition would often be chosen as the pivot element. Unfortunately, this causes worst-case behavior on already sorted arrays, which is a rather common use-case...." [Wikipedia]

 time: average
