## hash tables

h(key) = int

![hashmap](hashmap.png)

A good hash function h(key) = int needs the following properties:
* It should be deterministicâ€”equal keys must produce the same hash value.
* efficient to evaluate
* uniformly distributed 

**types of hash functions**
 * ***Positive integers*** (known as modular hashing): h : key % M -> int.
 * ***Floating-point***: do modular hashing on the binary representation of the key.
 * ***String***: sum modular hash of each char element.

    h_i(x) = (Hash(x) + F(i)) % M
    keep trying i = 1....M until a spot is found.
 
    F(i) = i: linear probing
    
    F(i) = i^2: quadratic probing
    
    F(i) = i * Hash_2(x) : double hashing
